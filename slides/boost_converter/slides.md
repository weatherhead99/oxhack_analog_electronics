* Voltage & Current
* Kirchoff's laws
* Resistors
* Capacitors

### Electrons

* Electricity is the flow of electrons
* Two important properties: __charge__ and __energy__
* __Charge__ of an electron is fixed and _never changes_
* __Energy__ of an electron changes through interaction with circuit elements


----


### Voltage & Current

__Current:__
The amount of charge (i.e. number of electrons) passing a point per unit time.

$I = {{dQ}\over{dt}} $

__Voltage:__
The average difference in energy between electrons at two points

__Ground:__
A common (but arbitrary) voltage reference point for a circuit, chosen to have 0 energy.


----

### Kirchoff's Laws 1

1) Current at a node adds up to 0 (electrons can't be created or destroyed)

----

### Kirchoff's Laws 2

2) Voltage around a loop adds up to 0 (energy change must all be accounted for)

### Resistors

Dissipate energy as heat

$V=I\times R$

Useful for converting current into voltage (or vice versa), defining ratios of voltage drops, limiting current into other devices


----


### capacitors

<img src="capacitor.svg" width=200/>

Store energy temporarily by separating charge in an electric field.

$Q=c \times V$

$\Rightarrow I = c \times {dV \over dt}$

Respond to the _rate of change_ of voltage, not the voltage itself
Useful for filtering, smoothing, short term storage of a voltage

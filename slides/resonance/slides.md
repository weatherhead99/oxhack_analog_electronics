# Oxhack Analog Electronics
-------------------
## Session 5 - Resonance and Colpitts Oscillator


---

## Recap 


## New Stuff

----


## If you missed previous sessions

* Please ask for recap
* Please ask questions
* Please ask for help

## If you are a regular

* Encourage and help others
* Take turns building and debugging

----

## Usual Caveats Apply

* This isn't intended to explain the physics (but ask me if you're interested, I am a semiconductor physicist by training / background)

* This isn't comprehensive - good tutorials on the web, or read AoE

* This is complicated - don't worry if you don't "get it" all at once

* I mean it - we are really entering the swamp now!
